>>> Generates a program that checks if a string is a palindrome and will reverse the string for the user to verify. The string length will then be used to generate a random number (inclusive) which will serve as n for the fibonacci sequence. Finally, a total of 5 numbers will be selected from the same range to calculate an average.
